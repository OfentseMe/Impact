ðŸ“Š Number Range Summarizer

This project provides a utility to summarize a list of integers into ranges. The input is a comma-separated string, and the output is a summarized string where consecutive numbers are grouped into ranges (e.g., 1, 3, 6-8, 12-15, 21-24).

ðŸ§  Project Components
1. Main Class
The Main.java file initializes the summarization process by passing a hardcoded comma-delimited string of integers and printing the summarized output.

2. CommaDelimitedNumbers Class
  - The CommaDelimitedNumbers.java file implements the NumberRangeSummarizer interface:

- collect(String input): Parses the comma-separated input string into a Set<Integer>.

summarizeCollection(Set<Integer> input): Summarizes the collection of integers, grouping consecutive numbers into ranges.

3. NumberRangeSummarizer Interface
The NumberRangeSummarizer.java interface defines the contract for summarizers, with methods for collecting and summarizing numbers.

4. JUnit Tests
The NumberRangeSummarizerTest.java file includes unit tests using JUnit to ensure correct functionality:

Tests for collecting numbers from a string.

Tests for summarizing collections, including handling edge cases like empty or single-number collections.
